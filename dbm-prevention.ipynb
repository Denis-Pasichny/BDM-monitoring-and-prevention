You can learn more about using Kaggle Notebooks [in the documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks).\n\nHere's how to get started:\n\n**1. Verify Your Account (Required)**\n\nTo use the Kaggle Notebooks in this course, you'll need to verify your account with a phone number.\n\nYou can do this in your [Kaggle settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).\n\n**2. Make Your Own Copy**\n\nTo run any code in this notebook, you first need your own editable copy.\n\nClick the `Copy and Edit` button in the top-right corner.\n\n![Copy and Edit button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_1.png)\n\nThis creates a private copy of the notebook just for you.\n\n**3. Run Code Cells**\n\nOnce you have your copy, you can run code.\n\nClick the ▶️ Run button next to any code cell to execute it.\n\n![Run cell button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_2.png)\n\nRun the cells in order from top to bottom.\n\n**4. If You Get Stuck**\n\nTo restart: Select `Factory reset` from the `Run` menu.\n\nFor help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.\n\n🚨 **NOTE:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n🚨 **NOTE:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ⚙️ Section 1: Setup\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nThe Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the [google-adk](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) library for Python and its required dependencies, so you don't need to install additional packages in this notebook.\n\nTo install and use ADK in your own Python development environment outside of this course, you can do so by running:\n\n```\npip install google-adk\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.1 Configure your Gemini API Key\n\nThis notebook uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), which requires authentication.\n\n**1.
